For front end and back end, respectively, we employed HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DJANGO. On the website, we also included RAZORPAY.
This was a hackathon project that my partner and I tried to create. We tried to make a website where a person could see a lot of dishes listed and order the precise ingredients of the dish, say pasta. The person would then receive exactly the ingredients required and all of it measured packaged along with a set of instructions/recipe to follow, offering a healthy alternative to the unhealthily prepared food most food delivery apps deliver.

Even though we were unable to win this hackathon—which was our first ever—I am happy that we made it to the final round, it was a great learning experience.
